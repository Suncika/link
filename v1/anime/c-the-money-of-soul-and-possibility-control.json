For its citizens, however, life has not improved and unemployment, crime, suicide, and despair are rampant. Kimimaro, raised by his maternal aunt after the disappearance of his father and the death of his mother, is a scholarship student whose only dream is to live a stable, ordinary life.

From then on his fate is radically altered as he's drawn into a mysterious realm known as the Financial District, where he must compete in weekly tournaments called \"deals\" in order to keep his money and avoid losing his future.</p>","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k5ThBchoOyYVFRGKlkKB5sQDlLcWRqJncEV_uVcddzo0phdAEUsyUirZuAcSijX4aYB-0hOLKIs_ctLj_2imQqm9_sa3PV9EEb5P8CcqthULr1XM9M9MEbjZICYjyZWwy2SCrlxtvnzETQU_vtPGbOmMhIvJJ8gSLmbrycYL1xltQXJc8rUh0keem9MFASSSN4bow8RwD87l-EbSfnvW48lnUdapL4Q2fOrmSIFcI3wdMasiELMB11tT3_EebNHgzjMHngHqbVOpf0Y2l_bZBnY4wmtvqmKuhZiagy_RCJFBv7d6FTNBNR8lFK3KcCAeIpABaBE367s9zTgxwP15Git7bPzSGfuhRRIN1037zv-sA64b8NxvF_nYl0hGkf8shQDivfIIdxYpFFyshd355JSU-GkWvghXe3B1pr2y5vEKAxjBz5I5MKjyE2JvNNSeHP6OcvxCcX1F5w-jLKAcPfWgTR3NLKYGcTu8H_dcpfU4keBuSOW7CmjoYmCbtUPELxEXO9EhC2X1whZVQ3JhZtXtlfZ19QTU2iDlY3TF3sajkvoESsclNHn8HW6MKju_5nwPkMIYVZLd0LImOEAdXF8MebNQ3jGtyTu8R-UtWxMFbLCm=w225-h311-no","type":"TV","episodes":11,"status":"Finished Airing","producers":["Fuji TV","Jumondo","Sony Music Entertainment","Fuji Pacific Music Publishing"],"studios":["Tatsunoko Production"],"genres":["Action","Mystery","Super Power","Thriller"],"rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7,"download":"c-the-money-of-soul-and-possibility-control"}
